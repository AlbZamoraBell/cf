**trSEQ : tr style 16 steps SEQ with trig input per step**

  main functions : cf. Fundamental/SEQ3
  
  steps :   each step can be turned on/off manually by clicking it or can be automated
  
              and/or externally controlled thru its own trig input
            
              you can use an external keyboard, pad controller, or third party app to use your computer keyboard
            
              as a midi keyboard, via Core/midi-trigger-to-CV or Core/midi-to-CV
            
              or any CV/trigger source/modifier like Audible/Bernouilli's gate for randomness
            
  tap in :  input notes by clicking on the pad or sending trigs or sustained gates to the corresponding input
  
              (cf. steps)
            
  clear :   same as "tap in" but for deleting notes

**STEPS : variable quantiser**

    originally conceived as a companion for PLAYER,
  
    used between a LFO or a SEQ CV out and PLAYER's start input
  
    it will quantize 0 to 10 Volts CV to regular steps,
  
    allowing for regular slicing of breakbeat loops or anything else

**PLAYER : sampler [mod from Bidoo's OUAIve]**
  
  use right click menu to select a .wav or .aif sample (some hi-res or compressed ones won't open)
  
  gate :      the sample will be played while the gate is open (i.e. input > 0 V.)
  
                try retrigger mode (right click menu) with most seq's
              
                or use an enveloppe or ML gate delay to have a correct gate for your needs
              
  start :     use knob to choose start point and/or attenuverted CV input 
  
                (don't forget to "open" the attenuverter)
              
  speed :   same as start but for speed, very low setting will play reverse (from start point)
  
  trick :     use a square fast LFO on gate input and a saw LFO on start input to get dirty time stretch

**PEAK : Peak limiter**

  threshold :   turn it down from 10 V. to 0 V. until it lights up as the limiter acts
  
  make up :     turn it up to adjust gain, lights up when signal gets over 10 V.
  
  
  trick :     if input is unplugged, PEAK will output screen's voltage
  
                it can also be use as an attenu/amp.

**CUBE : a blank panel turned weird module**

  inputs :  each input receives CV to controle the rotation speed on a different axis
  
              modulate with a LFO, or any other signal
            
  output :  is Z coordinate of one of the points of the cube
  
              found it quite unpredictable, especially when inputs are modulated
            
              Pretty and experimental :)

**FOUR : 4 trigged solos/mutes**

  each signal "line" can be turned on/off or soloed, manually and/or triggered thru its own trig input
  
              you can use an external keyboard, pad controller, or third party app to use your computer keyboard
            
              as a midi keyboard, via Core/midi-trigger-to-CV or Core/midi-to-CV
            
              or any CV/trigger source/modifier like Audible/Bernouilli's gate for randomness
